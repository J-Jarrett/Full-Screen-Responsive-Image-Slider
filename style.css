    Position absolute within slider, 70px from bottom of screen (** changed to 0 after media queries bit). If 600px wide, starts from -600px (this will take it off screen, so set left to 0 to work on styling first. 
    Give it a bg col & text col, some pad, bit of marg under header.
    Then change left to -600px & opacity to 0, invisible.
=========
    Need to add another style, .slide.current.content to:
    - set opacity back to 1, visible;
    - use transform to reposition it 600px left to right;
    - write a transition function to slide in & become visible/opacity:1 over 0.7s,
    - set a small delay before this happens, so we get the image first, then the .content sliding in.
=========
TEST by changing class .current to other slide divs to check.
